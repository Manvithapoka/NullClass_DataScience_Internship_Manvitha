# Task 1 – Long Hair Identification

## 🔍 Project Overview
This task predicts a person's gender based on their **age** and **hair length** using a machine learning model.

## 🎯 Task Logic
- If **age is between 20 and 30**:
  - **Long hair → Female**
  - **Short hair → Male**
- If **age is below 20 or above 30**:
  - Model predicts gender **normally**, regardless of hair length.

## 🧠 Model
- Trained with Scikit-learn.
- Achieved accuracy above 70%.
- Includes GUI using Gradio.
